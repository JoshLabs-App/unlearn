// 内容数据层：第十章，紧接第九章——同一个 GAME_CONTENT 对象继续 push。
// index.html 里这个文件排在 chapter9.js 之后、audio-manifest.js 之前加载。
//
// Tier: L3（跟第八、九章同一个 tier，见 skills/joshlabs-dev/references/projects/english-game.md）
// 本章引入一个新 grammarTag：
//   - conditional（structure，占"一课一个新点"名额，3课内必须复现）：
//     条件句（if... , ...will...，first conditional），
//     第1课（watching-hockey）引入，第1/2/6/9课多次复现。
// present-perfect / comparative 继续复现。被动语态留给第11章。
//
// 剧情：第9章结尾"一封信写给Emma"的钩子在本章兑现——玩家带Emma去见Ho太太，
// 三人一起看那些旧信，确认Emma的书店前身、当年帮助过Ho家的年轻女子，
// 极可能就是Emma的祖辈或家族长辈（具体是谁、什么关系，留一点悬念给第11章
// 完整揭晓，不在这里一次性说完）。中间穿插"酒吧看冰球"这个加拿大文化场景
// 作为轻松的过渡日常（悬疑不是每一课都要推进，日常场景负责铺词汇广度）。
