// 内容数据层：第十一章，紧接第十章——同一个 GAME_CONTENT 对象继续 push。
// index.html 里这个文件排在 chapter10.js 之后、audio-manifest.js 之前加载。
// L3（第8-12章）倒数第二章。
//
// Tier: L3（跟第八/九/十章同一个 tier，见 skills/joshlabs-dev/references/projects/english-game.md）
// 本章引入 L3 最后一个新 grammarTag：
//   - passive（structure，占"一课一个新点"名额，3课内必须复现）：
//     被动语态（was written / was known for / was kept 等），
//     第1课（reading-together）引入，第1/3/4/5/6/8/10课多次复现。
// present-perfect / comparative / conditional 继续复现。
//
// **历史背景（Josh 2026-09-03拍板：挂靠真实的香港移民潮，动笔前做了网络查证，
// 不是凭印象编）**：
//   - 1984年《中英联合声明》宣布香港1997年将回归中国，触发了移民潮的开端；
//     许多香港家庭对回归后的未来感到不安。
//   - 1989年天安门事件后，这种不安进一步加剧，移民数字持续攀升，1994年左右达到高峰。
//   - 1984-1997年间约有33.5万香港人移民加拿大，多伦多和温哥华是最主要的落脚地；
//     多伦多的华人人口在1986-1991年间翻了一倍。
//   来源：BC知识网络"An Untold History"、Wikipedia "Hong Kong Canadians"条目、
//   Quartz报道 "Hong Kong is about to see a Tiananmen-era wave of migration"（2020）。
//   故事里只用了"1984年、家庭因回归的不确定感而做出移民决定"这一条主线史实，
//   没有虚构具体的移民政策细节或年代数字——Ho家/Uncle Lok的具体经历（打两份工、
//   靠邻居互助、写信传统）是私人化的虚构叙事，建立在真实的大背景之上，不是在
//   编造历史本身。
//
// 剧情：三人一起读完剩下的信，揭晓当年（1984年前后）Ho家因担忧回归后的未来
// 决定移民，靠着Lily（Emma的祖母）等邻居的帮助落脚——Lily当年开的小店也叫
// "Ten Letters"，Emma给自己书店取的名字，是在不知情的情况下呼应了祖母的传统。
// 两家的缘分早于这一代人的重逢。L3到本章结束，第12章是L1-L3阶段性的情感
// 高点（不是最终收尾——最终收尾留给L4/B2最后一章，见路线图说明）。
