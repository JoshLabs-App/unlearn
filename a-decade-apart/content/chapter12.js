// 内容数据层：第十二章，紧接第十一章——同一个 GAME_CONTENT 对象继续 push。
// index.html 里这个文件排在 chapter11.js 之后、audio-manifest.js 之前加载。
// L3（第8-12章，B1）最后一章。
//
// Tier: L3（不引入新grammarTag——present-perfect/comparative/conditional/passive
// 四个L3新点已经在第8-11章全部引入完毕，本章全部复现巩固）。
//
// 剧情：**不是整部故事的收尾**（2026-09-03 Josh 拍板：目标从B1改成B2，
// 见 Story roadmap 里的说明）——本章是L1-L3阶段的情感高点：大家一起办了
// 一场聚会，感谢这一路帮助过的人，并埋下一颗新种子（把老房子变成能帮助
// 新移民的社区空间）留给L4（B2）继续写下去。真正的收尾留给B2最后一章。
