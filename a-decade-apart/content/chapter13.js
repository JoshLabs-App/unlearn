// 内容数据层：第十三章，紧接第十二章——同一个 GAME_CONTENT 对象继续 push。
// index.html 里这个文件排在 chapter12.js 之后、audio-manifest.js 之前加载。
// 这是 L4（B2，第13章起，"真相与新生"）的第一章。
//
// Tier: L4（见 skills/joshlabs-dev/references/projects/english-game.md）
// 本章引入 L4 第一个新 grammarTag：
//   - past-perfect（structure，占"一课一个新点"名额，3课内必须复现）：
//     过去完成时（had already / by the time... had...），
//     第1课（the-owner-calls）引入，第1/5/6课多次复现。
// present-perfect/comparative/conditional/passive（L3）继续复现巩固。
//
// 剧情：呼应第12章结尾埋下的种子——现任房主决定卖掉老房子，大家真的要把它
// 变成帮助新移民的社区空间了。第7课出现第一个真正的"受益家庭"，呼应几十年前
// Lily帮助Ho家的那条线，主题从"揭开过去"转向"创造新的开始"。
