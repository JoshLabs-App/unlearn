// 内容数据层：第十四章，紧接第十三章——同一个 GAME_CONTENT 对象继续 push。
// index.html 里这个文件排在 chapter13.js 之后、audio-manifest.js 之前加载。
//
// Tier: L4（跟第十三章同一个 tier，见 skills/joshlabs-dev/references/projects/english-game.md）
// 本章引入 L4 第二个新 grammarTag：
//   - subjunctive（structure，占"一课一个新点"名额，3课内必须复现）：
//     虚拟语气基础（I wish I had... / If I were you, I'd...），
//     第4课（nervous-before-teaching）引入，第4/7/9课多次复现。
// past-perfect（第十三章）继续复现，present-perfect/comparative/conditional/
// passive（L3）也继续巩固。
//
// 剧情：Lily's House开始办英语班，呼应整个游戏"用英语能力推进剧情"的核心主题——
// 玩家从"学英语的人"变成"帮别人学英语的人"。也借这个机会给一直是配角的Sam
// 一点篇幅：他其实一直在悄悄上夜校，想考教师资格。
