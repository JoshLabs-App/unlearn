// 内容数据层：第十五章，紧接第十四章——同一个 GAME_CONTENT 对象继续 push。
// index.html 里这个文件排在 chapter14.js 之后、audio-manifest.js 之前加载。
//
// Tier: L4（跟第十三、十四章同一个 tier，见 skills/joshlabs-dev/references/projects/english-game.md）
// 本章引入 L4 第三个新 grammarTag：
//   - reported-speech（structure，占"一课一个新点"名额，3课内必须复现）：
//     间接引语（she said that... / he told me he had...），
//     第2课（the-interview）引入，第2/3/6课多次复现。
// subjunctive/past-perfect（L4）与 present-perfect/comparative/conditional/
// passive（L3）继续复现巩固。
//
