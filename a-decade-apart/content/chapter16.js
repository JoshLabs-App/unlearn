// 内容数据层：第十六章，紧接第十五章——同一个 GAME_CONTENT 对象继续 push。
// index.html 里这个文件排在 chapter15.js 之后、audio-manifest.js 之前加载。
//
// Tier: L4（跟第十三/十四/十五章同一个 tier，见 skills/joshlabs-dev/references/projects/english-game.md）
// 本章引入 L4 第四个新 grammarTag：
//   - concession（structure，占"一课一个新点"名额，3课内必须复现）：
//     让步/对比连接词（although/despite/however，比L2的because/so更进一步），
//     第3课（although-we-struggle）引入，第3/6/9课多次复现。
// subjunctive/past-perfect/reported-speech（L4）与L3四个点继续复现巩固。
//
// 剧情：不是一路顺风——翻修和运营的实际花费比预算的多，Lily's House遇到
// 第一次真正的危机。靠社区众筹办法撑过去，呼应"新生"主题里"新生不是一路
// 平坦"的真实感。
