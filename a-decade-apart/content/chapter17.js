// 内容数据层：第十七章，紧接第十六章——同一个 GAME_CONTENT 对象继续 push。
// index.html 里这个文件排在 chapter16.js 之后、audio-manifest.js 之前加载。
//
// Tier: L4（见 skills/joshlabs-dev/references/projects/english-game.md）
// 本章引入 L4 第五个新 grammarTag（超出原计划的四个，视词汇/语法进度自然生长）：
//   - conditional-advanced（structure，占"一课一个新点"名额，3课内必须复现）：
//     更复杂的条件句（second conditional：if + 过去式, would + 动词原形，
//     表达假设性的现在/未来，跟L3的first conditional区分开——那个是"真的可能
//     发生"，这个是"假设、不一定发生"），第2课（if-the-city-helped）引入，
//     第2/5/8课多次复现。
// past-perfect/subjunctive/reported-speech/concession（L4其他四点）与L3四点
// 继续复现巩固。
//
// 剧情：市议会一位工作人员来访，提出可能给Lily's House一笔市政资助——
// 带来一个两难：拿了资助意味着更多规范和审查，但也意味着更稳定。大家一起
// 权衡利弊做决定，呼应"新生"主题里"成长也伴随取舍"的现实感。
