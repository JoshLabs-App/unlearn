// 内容数据层：第二十章，紧接第十九章——同一个 GAME_CONTENT 对象继续 push。
// index.html 里这个文件排在 chapter19.js 之后、audio-manifest.js 之前加载。
//
// Tier: L4（不引入新grammarTag——L4七个语法点已在第13-19章全部引入完毕，
// 见 skills/joshlabs-dev/references/projects/english-game.md）
//
// **场景领域切换（Josh 2026-09-03拍板）**：前19章一直围着"Lily's House
// 社区空间"这个圈子打转，核心高频词已经用得差不多了，新词密度自然放缓
// （第12-19章平均每章只新增约46词）。这一章切换到一个完全没碰过的新领域——
// 永久居民/入籍申请流程——跟主角"当年拿着护照入境"（第1章）首尾呼应，
// 又能带出一整块此前没用过的词汇（申请、文件、资格、面试、宣誓、仪式等），
// 目标是提高单章新词密度，减少到B2门槛还需要的章节数。
