// 内容数据层：第六章，紧接第五章——同一个 GAME_CONTENT 对象继续 push。
// index.html 里这个文件排在 chapter5.js 之后、audio-manifest.js 之前加载。
//
// Tier: L2（跟第四、五章同一个 tier，见 skills/joshlabs-dev/references/projects/english-game.md）
// 本章不引入新 grammarTag。剧情里程碑：路线图里"第一次由NPC完整用过去时讲述
// 一段往事"在本章兑现（第5课 a-story-unfolds、第6课 the-story-continues 两课，
// Ho太太用连续几句过去时叙述自己的童年）——这是 NPC 输入，不受产出语法上限约束，
// 但刻意写得情感真挚、有画面感，配得上"故事第一次真正打开"这个分量。
// 悬疑线只揭晓"Ho太太一家曾住在那栋房子里"这个片段，不涉及具体史实
// （移民政策/年代细节留给第11章按 Josh 拍板的方向做过研究后再写，这里只写
// 私人化的家庭记忆，不编造真实历史背景）。结尾埋下第7章"拜访Ho太太的哥哥，
// 听他讲完整往事"的钩子。
