// 内容数据层：第九章，紧接第八章——同一个 GAME_CONTENT 对象继续 push。
// index.html 里这个文件排在 chapter8.js 之后、audio-manifest.js 之前加载。
//
// Tier: L3（跟第八章同一个 tier，见 skills/joshlabs-dev/references/projects/english-game.md）
// 本章引入一个新 grammarTag：
//   - comparative（structure，占"一课一个新点"名额，3课内必须复现）：
//     比较级/最高级（bigger than / the best / the brightest yet 等），
//     第1课（the-old-house）引入，第1/5/6/7/9课多次复现。
// present-perfect（第八章引入）继续复现。条件句/被动语态留给第10/11章。
//
// 剧情：终于走到照片里那栋房子（呼应第2章的老照片、第4章的旧账本、第6章的
// 剪报、第7章Uncle Lok的回忆）——现任房主友善地让他们进去看看，在墙角找到
// 一批旧信。原计划第9章是圣诞节，但第5章已经改写成圣诞节了，这里改成春节
// （Josh 2026-09-03 拍板，也跟第11章"香港移民潮"历史线呼应更自然）。
// 结尾：Ho太太读了几封信，发现其中一封写给"Emma"——直接把悬疑线跟主角
// 身边最亲近的人连起来，作为第10章的钩子。
